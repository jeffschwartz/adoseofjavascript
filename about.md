In my career I have used many different programming languages (too many for me to even remember at times) and JavaScript is my favorite out of all of them. Why, you ask? Because JavaScript is amazing, that's why. OK I know I am being a little obtuse so here are a few reasons why I believe that:

1. JavaScript embraces asynchronous runtimes such as the browser and NodeJs. In most other programming languages support for asynchronous programming and runtimes feels almost like a kludge. JavaScript takes it to a whole other level.
2. JavaScript allows you to build semantically rich and expressive code and makes the process of developing APIs almost trivial. As an example, take the APIs developed for the numerous JavaScript BDD testing frameworks that are popular today. These can be viewed as almost DSL-like (Domain Specific Language) as they semantically express the process that encompasses the testing of code. Underlying the ease of use that these APIs provide are JavaScript's support for asynchronous functions, functions as first class objects and an extensible object based system built on top of prototypal inheritance.
3. The JavaScript eco-system -- tooling, task management, editor support, open source projects, etc. -- is second to none and when considered in its entirety is actually breathtaking.

So welcome to my blog "A Does Of JavaScript" which will serve as my vehicle for expressing my excitement and passion for everything JavaScript.
